		 <p>Football  has always been a game filled with passion. Back in 7th grade when I played football
		 for my school team for the first time, I remember feeling a surge of happiness flood through my body when I scored my first goal. 
		 As the years passed by, I got promoted to be the captain of the team. Playing alongside some of my best buddies will always be one of my best memories.
		 </p>

		 <p> Yet, one thing bothered me. Some time around 9th grade, the football teams were supposed to get their own jerseys as now we were
		 going to represernt our school in district levels. Since the budget wasn't too high, the boys' team received the jerseys but the girls'
		 team had to wait for another year. 
		 </p>

		 <p> This isn't the first time girls have been discriminated against in the sports field. Take for example the american women's
		 football team. They have been consistently earning high rankings compared to the men's team, and yet they earn lesser than 
		 what the men earn.
		 </p>

		<p>To eliminate such inequalities, we must:
		<ul>
		<li>support women's sports as muxh as we support men's sports</li>
		<li>be open to voicing against plain prejudice and discrimination</li>
		</ul></p>
